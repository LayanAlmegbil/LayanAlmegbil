## 👩🏻‍💻 About Me

I’m a Computer Science graduate from Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University, with a focus on Data Science, Data Analysis, and Artificial Intelligence. 
My passion lies in building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems—especially in areas like accessibility, Arabic language processing, and human-computer interaction.
I’m particularly drawn to projects that blend structured data with creative thinking, whether it’s analyzing patterns, building predictive models, or developing smart applications powered by machine learning.

Outside the technical space, I enjoy simplifying complex ideas, exploring new tools, and contributing to meaningful tech that makes a difference 🧠!
